# Black-Scholes option pricing theory

## Hedging and the partial differential equation

The original derivation of the Black-Scholes partial differential equation was via stochastic calculus, Ito's lemma and a simple hedging argument (Black & Scholes, 1973).

Assume that the underlying follows a lognormal random walk
$$
	dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dX.
$$
Use $\Pi$ to denote the value of a portfolio of one long option position and a short position in some quantity $\Delta$ of the underlying:
$$ 
	\Pi = V(S,t) - \Delta S.
$$

The first term on the right is the option and the second term is the short asset position.

Ask .... $t$ to $t+dt$.
$$
	d\Pi = dV -
$$

From Ito's lemma we have
$$
	d\Pi = \frac{\partial V}{\partial t}dt + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}dS +
	\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}dt -
$$

.....

$$
	d\Pi = \Big( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + ...\Big)dt.
$$

$$
	V(S,T)=\max(S-K,0)
$$
